# AlertMe-Android app
We designed the interface of a task reminder app with a new fashion design. AlertME: Tasks & To-Doâ€™s is a location-driven to-do list, which reminds users to complete tasks when they are in an area in which the task has to be completed.

What is in AlertME?
 Can see the amount of time left in order to complete the next tasks in the home screen
 Overdue tasks are highlighted in the home screen to grab the attention of the user
 Can change the alert mechanisms of next tasks in the homepage without  explicitly going to the settings 
 Can view the task name along with its location in the map
